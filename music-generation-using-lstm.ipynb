    "Music primarily consists of notes and chords, serving as fundamental elements in its composition. Music can be considered as a sequence of these notes and chords. Notes act as the building blocks, conveying both the pitch (or frequency) of the sound and its duration. For example, in “C4”, “C” represents the pitch of the sound and the number “4” represents its duration. On the other hand, chords are formed by playing multiple notes simultaneously. For example, the notation 'A4:G4' represents two notes, 'A4' and 'G4', played together. We can obtain these sequences of notes and chords from MIDI files. The task is how can we use these sequences of notes and chords to train the model and finally use it to generate music.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical music dataset contains the albums of various musicians. Every album comprises music stored as MIDI files. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) serves as a technical specification outlining a communication protocol, digital interface, and electrical connectors. It facilitates the connection of diverse electronic musical instruments, computers, and associated audio devices for the purpose of playing, editing, and recording music. Whenever a musician interacts with a MIDI instrument, whether pressing keys, buttons, or adjusting knobs and sliders, these actions are translated into MIDI data. (source: [MIDI - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the music data for training a model like a neural network, the first step involves extracting information from these MIDI files and transforming it into a suitable format. The Python library \"Music21\" proves invaluable for this task, offering a range of tools tailored for working with music data."

    "\n",
    "2. **Defining inputs and labels: We establish a fixed-length sequence of notes or chords to serve as the input features for each sample. For instance, we might choose a sequence length of 10 elements. The label for a given input sequence is determined as the note or chord immediately following the end of that sequence. This label represents what the model should predict.**\n",

    "3. Training Set Creation: Generate numerous input-output pairs using the fixed-length sequences and their corresponding labels. These pairs constitute our training dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Generation: Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate music sequences. To do this, we provide an initial input sequence (seed) to the model, and it predicts the next musical element based on its learned patterns. The predicted element is then added to the input sequence, and the process is repeated iteratively to generate a longer music sequence. By leveraging the knowledge acquired during training, the model can produce new music that follows the style and structure of the training data. This generated music can be further refined or adjusted based on artistic preferences or specific requirements.\n",
